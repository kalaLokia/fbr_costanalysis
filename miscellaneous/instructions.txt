For run (debug) the application
>> python runapp.py


For creating Windows application
>> pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole runapp.py


Files in this directory has to be in root to workout, this directory is not a python module dir.


Miscellaneous has no relation to application, those are just the things I tested out.
